This is a simple HTML project that uses the latest version of Bootstrap.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `css/style.css`: Custom CSS file for additional styles.
- `js/script.js`: Custom JavaScript file for additional scripts.
- `lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css`: Minified Bootstrap CSS file.
- `lib/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js`: Minified Bootstrap JS file.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project.

## Usage

You can edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed for your project. The Bootstrap files are included for convenience, but you can replace them with a different version if you prefer.

Remember to include the Bootstrap CSS in the head of your HTML file and the Bootstrap JS just before the closing body tag. Also, include your custom CSS and JS files after the Bootstrap files to ensure that your custom styles and scripts take precedence.
